# guessBMW

An iOS application I developed for educational purposes as a preparation for a contest.

It is a game where the player is presented with three pictures and one BMW model name. The player then has to tap the image corresponding to the model name. After 10 correct selections, the player is presented with his score, which is then appended to score table view.

There are major flaws within the code and under specific circumstances, the application may crash.

The code is crap, but then again, I wrote the app in 2 days with no prior knowledge of Swift.
